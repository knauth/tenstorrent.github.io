# Warp 100 Bridge

## Compatibility

The Warp 100 bridge is compatible with the following AI Graph Processor cards:

- Wormhole™ n150s with Passive Cooler (TC-02001)
- Wormhole™ n300s with Passive Cooler (TC-02003)
- Wormhole™ n300d with Active Cooler (TC-02004)

Each card supports up to two Warp 100 bridges.

## Installation

Warp 100 bridges are typically pre-installed in systems. However, if they require removal/replacement/reinstallation, they are keyed to be installed in a specific orientation. The Tenstorrent logo on the bridge should be rotated 270° (or -90°) as shown below:

Do **not** try to install it in the opposite orientation, as you risk damaging the card and the Warp 100 bridge.
