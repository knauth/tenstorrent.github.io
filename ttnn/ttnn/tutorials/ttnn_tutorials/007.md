# Build a graph of a pytorch based model

In this tutorial, we walk you through the steps of building a graph of a pytorch model. The example chosen will be the Dit-XL/2 Model. Note that many of these steps mirror what you see here: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/DiT/blob/main/run_DiT.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/DiT/blob/main/run_DiT.ipynb). More details on this model can be found at [https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT?tab=readme-ov-file)

The assumption is that this notebook has access to a machine with a Tenstorrent device and that tt-metal has been successfully built.

We will follow these steps: - Clone the library from [https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT.git](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT.git) - Download DiT-XL - Sample from the Pre-trained DiT Models and build the graph - Display the graph
